## Getting started

If you want to contribute to `screenkey.nvim`, and you don't have a specific idea in mind, you can check the
[TODO](TODO.md) list for some ideas.

## Commit messages / PR title

Please ensure your pull request title conforms to
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

## CI

GitHub Actions will run the following checks on your PR:

- `busted` tests
- `luacheck` linting for lua files
- `markdownlint` linting for markdown files
- `stylua` formatting - checks if the lua files are formatted correctly

If any CI check fails, review the logs, correct any issues in your code, and push the changes. If you're unsure, feel
free to ask for assistance in the discussions or open an issue for guidance.

## Development

We use the following tools:

### Formatting

- [`.editorconfig`](https://editorconfig.org/)
- [`stylua`](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua)

### Linting

- [`luacheck`](https://github.com/mpeterv/luacheck) for lua files
- [`markdownlint`](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) for markdown files

### Static type checking

- [`lua-language-server`](https://luals.github.io/wiki/)

### Running tests

We use [`busted`](https://lunarmodules.github.io/busted/) for testing, but with Neovim as the Lua interpreter.

You can run the test suite using `luarocks test` or `busted`. For more information on how to set up Neovim as a Lua
interpreter, see [`nlua`](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nlua).

### Manual testing

If you want to test your contributions to `screenkey.nvim` manually, we recommend you set
[`NVIM_APPNAME`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#%24NVIM_APPNAME) to something other than `nvim`, so that your
test environment doesn't interfere with your regular Neovim installation or the plugins you use.

## Documentation

If you want to contribute to the documentation, please follow these guidelines:

- If your focus is not inline code comments, please **only** edit the `README.md` file â€” Neovim help docs will be
  automatically generated from it.
- Keep your changes consistent with the existing documentation in terms of tone, style, and formatting.
- Use fenced code blocks (` ```lua `, ` ```vim `, etc.) where appropriate to improve readability.
- When documenting new features, include brief usage examples if possible.
- Avoid typos and grammatical errors. Use a spell checker or LLM if needed.

### Adding examples of usage

If you have an interesting use case for `screenkey.nvim`, or an unique configuration, please consider opening a issue
with your example. Include screenshots or GIFs if possible, and

## General tips when writing code

- try to keep the code you add consistent with the existing code base
- use `---@param`, `---@return`, `---@type`, etc. annotations for functions/variables
- keep functions small and focused on a single task
- write comments for complex code
- write tests for your code (if you don't know how, or if it's too complex, ask for help)
